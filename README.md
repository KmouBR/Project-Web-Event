# Turma da Alegria Project

The Turma da Alegria project aims to rescue the joy that is often forgotten in our hearts. We want to show people the true meaning of overflowing love, whether through a hug, a gesture of affection, attention or concrete actions, such as helping families who face difficulties with food and other basic needs.

This is a real fundraising project if you are interested, intended for a college semester project.
